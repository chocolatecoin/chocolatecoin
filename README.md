Chocolatecoin - a 'faster' version of Litecoin which also uses scrypt
as a proof of work scheme and is intended for microtransactions.
 - 15 seconds block targets
 - 42 007 680 total coins
 - no subsidy within the first 3 days and after approximately 5 years;
    in between: 4 coins per generated block
 - difficulty retargets every 0.35 days
 - currently peers are looked up over IRC only
 - currently no block checkpoints are in the code (but could be easily
   added)
Other than that, this coin is exactly like Litecoin. All of the coin parameters
are chosen arbitrarily or at most with 'fairness' towards everyone in mind.

-------------------------
Chocolatecoin intended features

- Easy mining setup (Maybe through wallet built in miners)
- Mined via a future un-named social network
- Rewardable on completion of task *
- Some kind of minting (time event based?)
- Anonymity?


Chocolatecoin will not be anything new as a coin (don't fix what isn't broken). The coin will be heavily supported with features to make it literally a gateway coin for quick public adoption.
